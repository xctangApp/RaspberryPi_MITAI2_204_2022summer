For 2022 MIT AI2 summer Capstone project, suggested device to purchase is CanaKit Raspberry Pi 4 4GB Starter PRO Kit which has OS pre-installed in Micro SD in the kit.

Below install guide is for Raspberry Pi without OS pre-installed in Micro-SD card.

For more detailed installation info, please check https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up

## SSH into your Raspberry Pi
- [Enable SSH](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/): Need reboot OS.
  - Raspberry Pi Configuration -> Interfaces -> SSH: Enable
  - Or Run `$ sudo raspi-config`. This also can be used to enable Camera.
- [Set up Static IP address](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/tcpip/)
  - In your MBP, check your default Gateway IP of your local network.
    ```
    $ netstat -nr | grep default
     default            192.168.86.1       UGSc           en0
     default                                 fe80::%utun0                    UGcI          utun0
     default                                 fe80::%utun1                    UGcI          utun1
    ```
  - In your Raspberry Pi, modify `/etc/dhcpcd.conf` to set up static IP addresses at the bottom. wlan0 is wireless IP.
    ```
    pi@raspberrypi:~ $ nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
    ...
    # fallback to static profile on eth0
    #interface eth0
    #fallback static_eth0
    
    interface eth0
    
    static ip_address=192.168.86.100/24
    static routers=192.168.86.1
    static domain_name_servers=192.168.86.1
    
    interface wlan0
    
    static ip_address=192.168.86.200/24
    static routers=192.168.86.1
    static domain_name_servers=192.168.86.1
    ...
    
    pi@raspberrypi:~ $ reboot
    ```
- In your Raspberry Pi, Check the IP address: Run `$ ping raspberrypi.local` in your Raspberry Pi.
- In your MBP, SSH into your pi from another computer. Default password is `raspberry`.
    ```
    ‚ùØ ssh pi@192.168.86.200
