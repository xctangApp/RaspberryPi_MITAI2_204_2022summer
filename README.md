## Set up your Raspberry Pi
[Setting up your Raspberry Pi](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up)

- Insert the microSD card into the card slot on the underside of the Raspberry Pi.
- Plug the USB keyboard into one of the USB ports.
- Plug the USB mouse into one of the USB ports
- Plug the HDMI or video component cable into the monitor or TV set. Turn on your monitor or TV set and make sure it is set to the proper input (e.g. HDMI 1 or Component)
- Connect USB WiFi Dongle or Ethernet Cable to the Raspberry Pi.
- Plug the power supply into the power outlet. This will turn on and boot up Raspberry Pi. 
- A start screen should appear on the monitor or TV you're using.
  - set up timezone
  - connect wifi network
  - upgrade OS

## SSH into your Raspberry Pi
- [Enable SSH](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/): Need reboot OS.
  - Raspberry Pi Configuration -> Interfaces -> SSH: Enable
  - Or Run `$ sudo raspi-config`. This also can be used to enable Camera.
- [Set up Static IP address](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/tcpip/)
  - In your MBP, check your default Gateway IP of your local network.
    ```
    $ netstat -nr | grep default
     default            192.168.86.1       UGSc           en0
     default                                 fe80::%utun0                    UGcI          utun0
     default                                 fe80::%utun1                    UGcI          utun1
    ```
  - In your Raspberry Pi, modify `/etc/dhcpcd.conf` to set up static IP addresses at the bottom. wlan0 is wireless IP.
    ```
    pi@raspberrypi:~ $ nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
    ...
    # fallback to static profile on eth0
    #interface eth0
    #fallback static_eth0
    
    interface eth0
    
    static ip_address=192.168.86.100/24
    static routers=192.168.86.1
    static domain_name_servers=192.168.86.1
    
    interface wlan0
    
    static ip_address=192.168.86.200/24
    static routers=192.168.86.1
    static domain_name_servers=192.168.86.1
    ...
    
    pi@raspberrypi:~ $ reboot
    ```
- In your Raspberry Pi, Check the IP address: Run `$ ping raspberrypi.local` in your Raspberry Pi.
- In your MBP, SSH into your pi from another computer. Default password is `raspberry`.
    ```
    ‚ùØ ssh pi@192.168.86.200
